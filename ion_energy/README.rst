Ionization energies for the neutral atoms
=========================================

This data was taken from:

http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/IonEnergy/tblNew.html

The html page was saved to orig.html. Use ``parse.py`` to process it.

The values are in ``eV``. The uncertainties are mainly in the range from less
than one to several units in the last decimal place, but a few of the values
may be in error by 20 or more units in the final place; i.e., the error of some
of the two place values could be greater than 0.2 eV.
